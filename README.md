# Tinode Instant Messaging Server

<img src="docs/logo.svg" align="left" width=128 height=128> Instant messaging full stack. Backend in pure [Go](http://golang.org) (license [GPL 3.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)), clients for Android (Java), iOS (Swift), and web (ReactJS), as well as [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client support for C++, C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Objective-C, etc (all clients licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)). Wire transport is JSON over websocket (long polling is also available) or [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) with gRPC.

This is beta-quality software: feature-complete and stable but probably with a few bugs or missing features. Follow [instructions](INSTALL.md) to install and run or use one of the cloud services below. Read [API documentation](docs/API.md).

Tinode is *not* XMPP/Jabber. It is *not* compatible with XMPP. It's meant as a replacement for XMPP. On the surface, it's a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram.

> **Personal fork note:** I'm using this repo to learn Go backend development and experiment with self-hosted messaging. My setup notes are in [PERSONAL_NOTES.md](./PERSONAL_NOTES.md).
>
> **Local dev setup:** Running with MySQL backend on Ubuntu 22.04. To start locally: `./server/server --config=./server/tinode.conf`. Default port is 6060. See `PERSONAL_NOTES.md` for Docker Compose setup I use for the database.

## Why?

The promise of [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) was to deliver federated instant messaging: anyone would be able to spin up an IM server capable of exchanging messages with any other XMPP server in the world. Unfortunately, XMPP never delivered on this promise. Instant messengers are still a bunch of incompatible walled gardens, similar to what AoL of the late 1990s was to the open Internet.

The goal of this project is to deliver on XMPP's original vision: create a modern open platform for federated instant messaging with an emphasis on mobile communication. A secondary goal is to create a decentralized IM platform that is much harder to track and block by the governments.

An explicit NON-goal: we are not building yet another Slack replacement.
